We introduce a new tool for dynamic metabolic modeling â€“ AUMIC (AUtomated tool for Metabolic modeling Integrated with the Cybernetic regulatory mechanisms)! 

AUMIC is a MATLAB toolbox that enables automatic construction of multiple types of cybernetic models (Ramkrishna and Song, 2012;Ramkrishna and Song, 2018), including: 
* Lumped cybernetic model (LCM) (e.g., Kompala et al., 1986)
* Hybrid cybernetic model (HCM) (Kim et al., 2008; Song et al., 2009)
* Lumped hybrid cybernetic model (L-HCM) (Song and Ramkrishna, 2010; 2011)

The AUMIC can also implement other dynamic modeling approaches for comparative studies, e.g., lumped kinetic model (e.g., Bijkerk and Hall, 1977), and macroscopic bioreaction model (Provost and Bastin, 2004). 

In AUMIC, all of the foregoing approaches are subsumed as quasi-steady-state models which are formulated using a unifying framework through the following step-by-step procedures, i.e., 
*	Network decomposition into elementary modes (EMs) using efmtool (Terzer and Stelling, 2008) or metatool (von Kamp and Schuster, 2006) 
*	EM classification and processing
*	Design of kinetics for uptake fluxes (and kinetics for enzyme synthesis)

Through user-defined functions, one can flexibly account for any functional forms of kinetic equations (without being limited to Monod-type equations), and various types of reactor configurations (including batch, fed-batch, and continuous reactors). Moreover, the AUMIC provides the parameter identification routine so that one can develop their own models using specific experimental data. Finally, the results are quickly analyzed using the post-processing module.

The upcoming version of AUMIC will include dynamic predictions of cellular response to gene knock-outs, a key feature for the rational design of metabolic pathways in microorganisms. We expect to provide updates in the future to make AUMIC as effective and versatile as possible.
